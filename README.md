## ⚙️ Backend Architecture

> 💡 This project features **dual backend engines**, each specialized for a set of tasks:

- **Node.js (Express)** – for real-time interactions, REST APIs, and basic services
- **FastAPI (Python)** – for ML model integration, authentication, and future microservices

Each backend will have its own structured folder inside `/backend/`, to be pushed soon.
